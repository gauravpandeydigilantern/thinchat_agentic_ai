#### **2. Modular Dashboard Architecture**
- **Routing & File Structure:**
  - Each major module has its own route and API endpoint.
  - Maintain a global header and sidebar that persist across all pages.
- **Dashboard Modules:**
  - **Enrichment Module:** `/dashboard/enrich`
  - **My Contacts:** `/dashboard/contacts`
  - **Companies:** `/dashboard/companies`
  - **AI Writer:** `/dashboard/ai-writer`
  - **Contact List:** `/dashboard/contact-list` (optimized with horizontal scroll for large datasets)
- **File Organization:**
  - Use a component-based structure for clear separation of concerns.
  - Integrate Next.js App Router for streamlined page management.

#### **3. AI-Powered Messaging & Outreach**
- **AI Writer (Gemini-Powered):**
  - Auto-generate personalized sales messages and connection requests.
  - Integrate into contact and company list dropdowns.
  - Fine-tune AI responses based on lead details and company data.
  
#### **4. Data Enrichment & Lead Search**

  - Enable users to search for contacts and companies with filters (industry, job title, location, etc.).
- **Integrated Enrichment APIs:**
  - Connect with multiple external APIs (e.g., Icypeas, FindyEmail, Apollo.io, Hunter.io, Clearbit) to enrich lead data.
  - Ensure enrichment actions are credit-based (each request deducts credits).
- **Sidebar Filters:**
  - Implement dynamic filtering for contacts and companies by criteria such as industry, location, engagement level, and lead score.

#### **5. Credit-Based System & Monetization**
- **Credit Consumption:**
  - Deduct credits for actions like AI message generation, sending connection requests, and data enrichment.
- **Credit Management API:**
  - Display remaining credits in the UI.
  - Provide mechanisms for credit purchase or subscription upgrades.

#### **6. CRM Integrations & Automation**
- **Third-Party CRM Integrations:**
  - Integrate with systems like Salesforce, HubSpot, and Pipedrive.
  - Enable automated data synchronization and webhook support.
- **Browser Extension (Future Consideration):**

#### **7. Reporting, Analytics & Security**
- **Reporting Dashboards:**
  - Provide analytics on lead generation performance, user engagement, and ROI metrics.
  - Allow exporting of custom reports.
- **User Roles & Permissions:**
  - Support multiple user roles (Admin, Sales Rep, Manager) with granular access control.
- **Compliance & Data Security:**
  - Ensure compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and other relevant regulations.
  - Implement robust security measures for data protection.

  - **GraphQL** (optional for flexible data querying)
  - **PostgreSQL** for relational data management
  - **Redis** for caching

- **AI & Machine Learning:**
  - Integration with **Google Gemini Model** for AI-powered messaging
  - Python microservices (if needed) for advanced ML tasks using TensorFlow/PyTorch

- **Integrations & Deployment:**
  - **Docker** for containerization and consistent deployment environments
  - **Kubernetes** for orchestration and scaling
  - **CI/CD Pipelines** (Jenkins/GitHub Actions) for automated testing and deployment
